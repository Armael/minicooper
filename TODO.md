# To do

- Maximal priority: fix the reduction behavior
- Check that we do not pollute the user with unneeded stuff (notations, tactics,
  Arguments...)
- Once the reduction behavior is fixed, relax it to allow computing with
  _ground_ constants
- Extend zify to handle ( | ), ( / ) and ( mod )
- Try on larger goals, profile, optimize?
